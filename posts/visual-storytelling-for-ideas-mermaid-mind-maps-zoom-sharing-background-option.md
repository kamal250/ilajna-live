While exploring mermaid.ai, I created a mind map to capture and organize one of the project requirements. To explain it more effectively, I decided to record a short video walkthrough—and the result turned out better than expected.

I also experimented with Zoom’s “Share as Background” feature while presenting the mind map. It proved to be a great option, enabling a clean, modern presentation layout while keeping the presenter visible and engaged throughout the discussion. This approach helped create a stronger connection with the audience while clearly communicating the ideas.
