I have been reading an interesting course on PMI elearning called "PMI Essentials M.O.R.E. Maximizing Project Success". I am impressed how the project value has been focused more, isn't that something we have been doing? I remember reading in 2020/2021 - "shipping more values". This course emphasized on 4 codes (I am referring as codes):

M - Manage Perceptions

O - Own Project Success

R - Relentlessly Reassess Project Parameters

E - Expand Perspective

The course has their own definition (I am referring their written statement as definition.)

Here is my version of understanding on them:

M - Understand stakeholder & influence how value is perceived 

O - I am responsible

R - Revisit project parameters, goals, success criteria

E - Not only think about your project but think about society/community/environment.

M.O.R.E. Readiness Diagnostic was an interesting tool and here is what my honest result on it.
