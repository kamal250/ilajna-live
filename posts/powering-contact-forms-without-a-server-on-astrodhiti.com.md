I’m currently working on my personal project [AstroDhiti.com](https://astrodhiti.com), a platform built to support my wife’s services as an astrologer. The entire project is [open source](https://github.com/kamal250/astrodhiti), originally cloned from an [interior-design-website](https://github.com/PriscaTonia/interior-design-website) template and then customized to suit our needs.

The website is built using a modern tech stack:
 Astro, React, and Tailwind CSS — ensuring performance, flexibility, and a clean UI.

### The Challenge: Serverless Contact Form

One key requirement was a [contact form](https://astrodhiti.com/contact/) that could notify me instantly when a user submits an inquiry — without setting up or maintaining any backend server. After exploring multiple options, I found the perfect solution.

### The Solution: Web3Forms

I integrated Web3Forms – Contact Forms for Modern Websites
 🔗 [https://web3forms.com/](https://web3forms.com/)

It stood out because:

* ✅ No backend required 
* ✅ Easy and quick integration 
* ✅ 250 free API submissions per month 
* ✅ Perfect for startups and personal projects 

The setup took just minutes and worked flawlessly from the first test. It delivers exactly what a modern website needs — simple, reliable, and serverless form handling.
